Disabling an on-premises proxy for GitLab CI/CD pipelines involves configuring GitLab and the GitLab Runner to bypass the proxy and allow direct access to external resources. Here are the steps you can follow:
1.	Identify Proxy Configuration:
•	Contact your enterprise's network or IT team to gather information about the on-prem proxy configuration, including the proxy server address, port number, and any authentication details required.
•	Determine if the proxy settings are applied at the system level or within GitLab's configuration.
I.	Examine GitLab Proxy Settings:
•	Log in to your GitLab instance as an administrator.
•	Go to the Admin Area by clicking on the top-right user icon and selecting "Admin".
•	In the left sidebar, navigate to "Network".
•	Check if there are any proxy settings configured within GitLab.
•	Note down the values of the proxy-related fields, such as "HTTP(S) Proxy Server", "Proxy User", "Proxy Password", etc.
II.	Consult Network or IT Team:
•	Reach out to your enterprise's network or IT team.
•	Ask for detailed information about the on-prem proxy configuration.
•	Inquire about the proxy server address, port number, proxy type (HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS), and any authentication requirements (username, password, domain).
•	Request clarification on any specific proxy rules or exclusions that may be in place.
•	By combining the information gathered from these steps, you will have a comprehensive understanding of the proxy configuration in your environment. This information can then be used to adjust the GitLab CI/CD pipeline settings and remove the dependency on the on-prem proxy.

2.	Update GitLab Runner Configuration:
•	Access the server hosting your GitLab Runner.
•	Locate the configuration file for GitLab Runner. The file is typically located at /etc/gitlab-runner/config.toml for Linux or C:\gitlab-runner\config.toml for Windows.
•	Open the configuration file using a text editor.
•	Look for the [runners.proxy] section within the file. If it doesn't exist, you can create it.
•	Within the [runners.proxy] section, you may find properties such as http_proxy, https_proxy, no_proxy, proxy_ca_bundle, etc.
•	Comment out or remove the lines related to the proxy configuration. For example:
[runners.proxy]
  # http_proxy = "http://proxy.example.com:8080"
  # https_proxy = "http://proxy.example.com:8080"
  # no_proxy = "*.example.com"
  # proxy_ca_bundle = "/etc/gitlab-runner/certs/ca.crt"
•	Save the configuration file and exit the text editor.
•	Restart the GitLab Runner service to apply the changes. The specific command to restart the service depends on your operating system.
3.	Adjust Git Global Settings:
•	Open a terminal or command prompt.
•	To check if there are any global Git proxy configurations, run the following commands:
git config --global --get http.proxy
git config --global --unset http.proxy

git config --global --get https.proxy
git config --global --unset https.proxy
•	If any proxy configurations are set, the get command will display the values. Use the unset command to remove them if necessary.

4.	Review Pipeline Configuration Files:
•	Open the .gitlab-ci.yml file in your repository using a text editor.
•	Search for any references to the on-prem proxy within the file.
•	Update or remove any references to the proxy settings as required. This may include environment variables, script commands, or package manager configurations.
•	Ensure that any URLs or external dependencies used in the pipeline are accessible without going through the proxy. Update them if needed.
5.	Test the Pipeline:
•	Commit and push the changes made to the .gitlab-ci.yml file.
•	Trigger a pipeline run by making a new commit or manually triggering it from the GitLab UI.
•	Monitor the pipeline execution closely.
•	Verify that the pipeline completes successfully without encountering any errors related to the on-prem proxy.
•	Pay attention to any external network requests made during the pipeline run and ensure they succeed without the need for the proxy.
6.	Monitor and Troubleshoot:
•	After disabling the on-prem proxy, closely monitor subsequent pipeline runs for any failures or network-related issues.
•	If a pipeline fails due to network errors, check the error messages and logs for clues about the cause.
•	Make adjustments to the pipeline configuration, environment variables, or network settings as necessary to resolve any issues encountered.
•	Consult GitLab's documentation, forums, or support channels for further troubleshooting assistance if needed.
•	It's important to note that the specific commands, file locations, and steps may vary depending on your operating system,

Disabling the on-prem proxy for GitLab pipelines means configuring GitLab to bypass any proxy server that is set up in your on-premises environment. By default, GitLab pipelines are designed to use the HTTP/HTTPS proxy settings defined in the system environment variables or the GitLab instance configuration. However, there may be situations where you want to disable the proxy specifically for pipelines to ensure direct access to external resources.

To disable the on-prem proxy for GitLab pipelines, you can follow these steps:
1.	Navigate to the project for which you want to disable the proxy. You can find your projects on the dashboard or use the search functionality.
2.	On the project's page, look for the settings menu. It is usually represented by a gear or cog icon and is typically located on the right side of the screen. Click on it to access the project's settings.
3.	In the project settings, you should see a sidebar on the left side of the screen. Look for the "CI/CD" option and click on it.
4.	Within the "CI/CD" settings, you should see a submenu. Look for the "Variables" option and click on it. This is where you can define the variables needed to disable the proxy.
5.	On the "Variables" page, you'll find a list of variables that are currently set for the project. To disable the proxy, you need to create two new variables.
6.	To create the first variable, click on the "Add Variable" button. This button is usually located near the top right corner of the page.
7.	A form should appear where you can define the variable. In the "Key" field, enter http_proxy if you have an HTTP proxy, or https_proxy if you have an HTTPS proxy.
8.	In the "Value" field, enter an empty string ("").
9.	Click on the "Add variable" button to save the variable.
10.	Now, create the second variable by clicking on the "Add Variable" button again.
11.	In the "Key" field, enter no_proxy.
12.	In the "Value" field, enter a comma-separated list of domains or IP addresses that should bypass the proxy. This list should include any external resources or services that your pipelines need to access directly.
13.	Click on the "Add variable" button to save the variable.
14.	Once both variables are saved, you can close the settings page.
15.	Trigger a pipeline for your project to test the changes. You can do this by committing and pushing changes to your repository or by using the GitLab UI to manually trigger a pipeline.

By following these steps and defining the http_proxy or https_proxy variable as an empty string, and providing the appropriate domains or IP addresses in the no_proxy variable, you will disable the on-prem proxy for GitLab pipelines in your project.
